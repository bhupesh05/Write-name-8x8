# Write-name-8x8
This is cool program that i have written in C# it will display your name is console with what character you want.
The following code has used long integer number instead of binary string to proccess the binary literals.
With use of long its is saving memory space.
I have used left shift operator to process the number to print 8x8 grid form.
